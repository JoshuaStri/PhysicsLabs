    "In this laboratory, there are a lot of calculations of the uncertainty in a derived quantity, based on the uncertainties in the raw quantities involved.  We can understand how to calculate these uncertainties using just a little bit of calculus!\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a function, $z = f(x,y)$.  We imagine that $x$ and $y$ are two independent raw quantities measured in the experiment, and $z$ is some derived quantity.  The chain-rule of differentiation, together with an assumption that the uncertainties are Gaussian in nature, lead to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "(\\delta z)^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}} \\right)^2 (\\delta x)^2 + \n",

    "\\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the function $z = \\frac{x}{y}$.  This particular relationship will be very useful in this experiment!  \n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation of density in Equation ([1](#mjx-eqn)) will require a determination of the mass and volume of each rod. The\n",
    "final density will be an average of the computations for each method of measuring the volume of the cylinder. We\n",
    "will need the uncertainty in the computed density. Using Equation ([2](#mjx-eqn)), we can show that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\left(\\frac{\\delta \\rho}{\\rho}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\delta m}{m}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\delta V}{V}\\right)^2\n",
    "\\tag{3}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "A second extremely important concept in this experiment is the calculation of the weighted average of a series of numbers, each of which has an uncertainty associated with it.  For example, imagine that we make four measurements of the same quantity, $x$, and have an uncertainty, $\\delta x$, for each of these four measurements.  The questions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) What is the $average$ of these four measurements?  \n",
    "(b) What is the $uncertainty$ in this average?\n",
    "\n",

    "However, when each of the measurements has an uncertainty, it is not so simple.  The idea is that we want to attach more importance to measurements with $small$ uncertainties, and less importance to measurements with $large$ uncertainties.  This is called calculating a $weighted$ average.  For Gaussian uncertainties, it turns out that the way that we do this is to calculate the average as:\n",

    "\n",
    "For the calculation of the uncertainty in $\\bar{x}$, there are $TWO$ separate uncertainties that we must consider.  The first is the normal statistical uncertainty, \n",
    "based on the fact that each of the individual measurements has an uncertainty.  This is\n",

    "\n",
    "The second part of the uncertainty in $\\bar{x}$ is based on the notion that the values $x_i$ vary from one another (even though in a perfect world that would all be identical since they represent the same physical quantity).  This variation is known as a $systematic$ uncertainty.  The calculation of this uncerainty is straightfoward but tedious.  The result is:\n",
