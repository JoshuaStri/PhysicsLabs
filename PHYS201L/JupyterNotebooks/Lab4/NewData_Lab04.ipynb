    "# Introduction\n",
    "In 1686, Isaac Newton published his three laws of motion using information he gained from experiments performed by both Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler:\n",
    "1. If there is no net force, there is no acceleration\n",
    "2. If there is a net force, then *F = ma*\n",
    "3. If object A places a force on object B, then object B places an equal but opposite force on object A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today you will be verifying Newton‚Äôs second law by using a known force to accelerate an airtrack glider, measuring that acceleration, and comparing it to the predicted acceleration."

    "First and foremost, you will need to compute the acceleration of the aitrack glider. The information you will have, however, is velocity computed by a photogate. The photogate measures the velocity of the glider as it passes through by timing how long the infrared LED is blocked by the object (sometimes called a ‚Äúflag‚Äù) passing through and uses the definition of velocity:  \n",

    "v \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta x$ is the length of the flag and $\\Delta t$ is the time the LED was blocked.\n",

    "### Force\n",
    "A proper prediction of the acceleration of the glider from Newton‚Äôs second law requires great care. Recall that the force of gravity on an object is given by $F = mg$ where $g \\equiv 9.81 \\pm 0.005 m/s^2$ so that $ \\delta g = 0.005 m/s^2$. You should find that the acceleration of the system is some fraction of g involving the masses of both the glider and the hanging mass."

The uncertainty in your predicted acceleration will depend on the uncertainty in ‚Äúg‚Äù as well as the uncertainties in the masses. The uncertainty in your ‚Äúmeasured‚Äù acceleration will depend on the uncertainties in your measured velocities and times.\n",

    "The Capstone software can measure time to within $ \\delta t = 0.1 ms$.\n",

    "Your Lab Manual and the previous labs can guide you in estimating the uncertainties in your measurements and propagating those uncertainties into your computed accelerations. The uncertainty in the masses of the glider and hanging mass will be determined by the accuracy of the scale. For your velocities, it might be easier to use the standard deviation of a large number of measurements as your measurement uncertainty. The uncertainty in your acceleration, however, will have to be computed using the three equations in your Lab Manual.\n",
